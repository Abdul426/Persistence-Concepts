Testing git fetch and pull

git fetch, fetches the changes but do not merge ...
git pull, fetches the changes and merges with local repos

git checkout:

-

git branch:

- git branch <topic-branch> will create a new branch. It automatically copies the changes to the new branch.
- git switch switches the branch. Once we commit a newly creaed topic branch the changes will be saved and the old branch from where we creaed a topic branch and imported the changes will not have the changes.
  Ex: topic2 created from topic1, topic2 imports all ongoing changes from topic1. Once we commit topic2 the changes will be saved into topic2 and topic1 will not have the changes.
